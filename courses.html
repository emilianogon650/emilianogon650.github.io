<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>I have taken various courses throughout my time at Saint Marys as I switched majors during my sophomore year from biology to computer science. Along with my major classes I have taken many interesting general education courses that have developed not only my intelligence and understanding but also my integrity and morality to become a better person.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<P>Throughout my time at Saint Marys I would say the top three classes I have enjoyed the most have been Data Visualization, Seminar Western Tradition II, and Asian Pacific and American History. I enjoyed Data Visualization because of the software program we used called Tableau which was hard to learn but once you got the hang of it extremely interesting to use for analyzing data. Seminar II I enjoyed because of my Professor who created a great seminar environment and challenged us to lead discussions without him getting involved. Lastly Asian Pacific American History was intriguing because of the activities and projects we were assigned which let us be creative. My courses such as programming I and II, database programming, data visualization, and Introduction to Automata and the Theory of Computation have helped me prepare for my future job as they have challenged me to critically think and make calculated decisions using software tools and programming languages such as SQL, Python, Java, and Tableau. </li>
