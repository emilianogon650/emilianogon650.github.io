<p>A corrido that reflects on themes of transformation, perseverance, and achieving success despite difficult circumstances. Peso Pluma narrates a story of someone who has overcome adversity to build a new and prosperous life. The lyrics often touch on personal growth, leaving behind old struggles, and embracing a new beginning, or "new life" (nueva vida), through hard work and determination.</p>

<h2>Love Yourz(J Cole)</h2>

<p>The song "Love Yourz" by J. Cole encourages listeners to find contentment and value in their own lives rather than chasing material wealth or comparing themselves to others. It emphasizes that true happiness comes from appreciating what you have, particularly the love and support from family and community, rather than external success. The song is a reflection on gratitude and self-worth.</p>

<h2>Nadie Sabe(Bad Bunny)</h2>

<p>In "Nadie Sabe" by Bad Bunny, he reflects on the hidden struggles and emotional pain he faces behind his public persona. The song explores themes of loneliness, vulnerability, and the pressures of fame, emphasizing that despite outward success, no one truly knows the internal battles he fights. It's a deeply introspective track, blending melancholy with a sense of resilience.</p>
