<h1>Movie Recommendations</h1>

<P>These are my three favorite films of all time and I highly recommend you watch them if you find the description I provide interesting.</p>

<h2>Good Will Hunting(1997)</h2>

<p>I believe that everyone should watch Good Will Hunting at least once in their life because its such a great good feel movie and also a movie with a main character who is very relatable as he struggles to make decisions about his future and deal with trauma from his past.</p>

<h2>Batman: The Dark Knight(2008)</h2>

<p>Although I think marvel superhero movies are better than DC I will forever say that the best superhero movie of all time is The Dark Knight because of the acting performance that Heath Ledger gave us as the joker. This movie introduces the joker to Christopher Nolans version of the adaptation and pushes batman to his limits. 

<h2>Coco(2017)</h2>

<p>How could I make a movie list without a Pixar movie. Coco is my favorite of all time because of the Mexican cultural aspects of the movie and the story of a young kid trying to achieve his dreams despite his family not supporting him.</P>
