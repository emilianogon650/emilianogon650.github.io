<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>I have many different hobbies and interests that mean a lot to me but if I had to narrow it down to four I would say they are futbol, movies, video games, and music.</p>

<h2>Futbol</h2>

<p>The 2014 World Cup was the first vivid memory I have of watching futbol. Watching the Mexico national team lose to the Netherlands was devastating but a memory I will never forget because it was the first time I had actually watched futbol. Since then I fell in love with the sport and decided to start supporting Real Madrid because my favorite Mexican player Chicharito had joined them. Since then I continue to support Real Madrid and the Mexico National team.</p>

<h2>Movies</h2>

<p>Another one of my interests is watching movies. I enjoy going to the movie theaters when new movies premiere because of the experience and snacks although they are overpriced. In terms of genres I have a broad desire to watch any film as long as it is well directed.

<h2>Video Games</h2>

<p>Video games have always been a big part of my life because of my older brother who introduced them to me from a young age. I have owned different types of consoles such as an Xbox 360, PS4, PSP, and PS5. My favorite games of all time are Fifa, Call of Duty, and Rainbow Six Siege.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>Music is I think is so powerful because of how one can relate to it. My favorite genres include reggaeton, corridos, rap, and r&b. Some of my favorite artists currently are Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida, Feid, and Bad Bunny.
